## Submerge&Survive

This project consists of a game inspired by “Lovers in a dangerous spacetime”, but
with many changes.

The game takes place in an ocean, where a submarine sails. Players can
move around inside the submarine and reach different places where they can perform
different actions, such as driving the submarine and firing its cannons.
However, the submarine's oxygen tank is limited and therefore it is necessary to come
to the surface to renew it. On the surface, there are enemies that players have
to defend themselves from.

Players can collect trash they find in bubbles in the ocean, earning
coins, in order to improve their conditions, namely recovering lives
lost, improve the oxygen tank, increase the firing rate of the cannons and
increase the player's speed.

The deeper they collect the trash, the more money they make. However, if, when trying
burst the bubbles, you kill some fish, you will lose coins.


> This game was developed for LCOM curricular unity. It required the programming of MINIX drivers for interfacing with the computer's timer, keyboard, real time clock, mouse, graphics card and serial port.
